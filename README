cim2gdi - README

| OVERVIEW |
cim2gdi is a tool for converting files generated with CD Craft from the SEGA
Katana (Dreamcast) SDK into GDI files for use with emulators and the DC2CD
tool.

| USAGE |
Simply run cim2gdi with the CIM file as the parameter.  Multiple track files
will be generated along with the corresponding GDI file.

This version of the tool requires 1.2GiB free RAM.

Example:
cim2gdi GAME.cim

This produces the tracks as .raw and .bin files, with .raw being audio and .bin
being data.

| BUILDING |
In order to build the source, you will need a Windows PC and Microsoft Visual
Studio (makefiles for MinGW and Visual Studio coming later).  Open the Solution
file in Source/Windows and build the Release version.


| ROADMAP |
The goal of this early build is to get something working that processes full
CIM files.  Unfortunately, this also means the code is not very elegant and the
functionality is lacking.

| ROADMAP/GOALS |
* Linux build
* MinGW build
* GUI to navigate the CIM file
* Progress indicators (currently takes ~2 minutes on a computer with an IDE
  hard drive, 2GiB 400MHz RAM, and a 1GHz 32-bit AMD Athlon)
* Non-full image format support
